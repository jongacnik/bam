Starter kit.

**In progress...**

## Featuring

- [choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo)
- [gr8](https://github.com/jongacnik/gr8) + [ress](https://github.com/filipelinhares/ress)
- scaffolding

## Notes

I like to keep it basic. I swap out choo with [rooch](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/rooch) or [byo](https://github.com/jongacnik/byo) as a project needs.

I create a bash alias for cloning this repo:

```bash
# in .bash_profile
alias bam='git clone https://github.com/jongacnik/bam'
```

usage:

```bash
$ bam project-name
```

## Todo

- [ ] Build scripts
- [ ] Write some details
- [ ] Maybe tweak how styles inserted
- [ ] Maybe lilcss
