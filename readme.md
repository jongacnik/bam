# ❗️️b❗️a❗️m❗️

My project boiler plate.

## Featuring

- [choo](https://github.com/jongacnik/byo)
- [gr8](https://github.com/jongacnik/gr8) + [ress](https://github.com/filipelinhares/ress)
- [budo](https://github.com/mattdesl/budo)

## Scripts

```bash
# start dev
npm start

# build dist
npm run build

# publish
npm run publish
```

## Notes

- Sometimes I swap out choo with [rooch](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/rooch).
- The publish command syncs to [dat](https://github.com/datproject/dat). I swap this with other options (like surge, netlify, ftp) as needed.

## Alias

I create a bash alias for cloning this repo:

```bash
# in .bash_profile
alias bam='git clone https://github.com/jongacnik/bam'
```

usage:

```bash
bam project-name
```
