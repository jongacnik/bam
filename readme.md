# ❗️️b❗️a❗️m❗️

Starter kit.

**Never finished...**

## Featuring

- [byo](https://github.com/jongacnik/byo) + [preact](https://github.com/developit/preact)
- [gr8](https://github.com/jongacnik/gr8) + [ress](https://github.com/filipelinhares/ress)
- scaffolding

## Notes

I like to keep it basic. It's easy to swap out the renderers in byo or to swap it out entirely with [choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo), as projects require.

### Scripts

```bash
# start dev
npm start

# build dist
npm run build
```

### Alias

I create a bash alias for cloning this repo:

```bash
# in .bash_profile
alias bam='git clone https://github.com/jongacnik/bam'
```

usage:

```bash
$ bam project-name
```

## Todo

- [ ] Force bundle refresh on `design.js` update
